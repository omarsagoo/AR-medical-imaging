# AR-medical-imaging

Welcome to my Database Application.

This Database will store information for Medical Files.

to check out the database:
git clone and $ flask run
    or 
https://med-imaging-db.herokuapp.com

The purpose of this database is for use of future medical apps that might rely on a database to store medical files.
This database will store all the information needed for that. 

Initially I would like to be able to connect the database to UNITY or something similar to display medical files in an 
AR medium. Creating an Augmented superimposed view of medical information for patients and the doctors, with information including
patient Demographics and Medical imaging, like MRIs or X-rays.
